          <p>
            I am an avid sportsperson. I love running and am currently focusing on improving my marathon time, so I run. A lot. Of course, as a Brit, I am also heavily invested in my football. I'm a GK when playing 11v11, and I support Gillingham FC, for all my sins. It's a stressful club to support, but it's in my blood and I wouldn't trade it for anything. And speaking of football, I wouldn't mind winning the occasional foosball trophy...<br>
            I <strong>LOVE</strong> traveling and visiting new places. I find that traveling heals the soul.<br>
            Aside from that, I love challenges and finding solutions which played a huge role in my decision to switch into the tech industry. I love the rollercoaster of emotions that come from programming. The high of finding a solution to fix a bug after several hours and hundreds of attempts is almost unmatched! And then the cycle begins again. It's great!

        <p class="para">I have been a volunteer web designer at Solaris Scholar and have designed the entire website as it currently stands, and am in the process of re-designing the entire thing to improve it, but this will not detract from any other work as I do it all in my spare time. I enjoy working on side-projects in my down time to improve and fine-tune my skills, and re-designing allows me to find new, and better, ways. I am currently fully self-taught in HTML and CSS and with my upcoming formal education in web and software development, I believe that my skills in coding and programming will only improve and become a valuable asset to have on your team.</p><br>

        <h2 class="title">Why You Should Hire Me</h2>
        <p class="para pick-me-para">
          I am a hard worker and always perform to the best of my ability. If I have questions, I feel it is best to ask instead of suffering in silence, as that just hinders both me and everyone else involved, so I will always be aiming to find answers when needed. I love learning, and being surrounded by people who know what I need to learn will be such a boost, both mentally and within my studies.<br>
          When I am faced with challenges, I prefer to find solutions myself before reaching out to others, unless a deadline is imminent. Therefore, if you hire me, I will be able to demonstrate independence and also the ability to work and communicate across the team where necessary.<br>
          When it comes to improving and succeeding, I do not only wish for my own success. I love celebrating the success and wins of others. As a runner, I love seeing other runners achieve their target times, or even just completing a distance they didn't think they could run. The workplace is no different. If one succeeds, we all succeed, and we all support and lift each other up when someone is down.<br>
          I may not be up to speed right now with software development, but I learn quickly and all I need is someone to give me a chance and guide me in the right direction.
